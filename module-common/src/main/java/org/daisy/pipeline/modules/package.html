  Modules are resource sets which may include xpl, xslt, css, schemas or any other kind of file grouped under a common name and version.
  Every module makes its resources available as components, these components are public URI / systemId pairs which
  allow any other module make use of the resources by just accessing the component's public resource identifier.
